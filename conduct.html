  Welcome to the <strong>Nonbinary Zone</strong> Discord community! It is a requirement of entry that you read <strong>everything</strong> here before moving onto other channels, so please take the time to do so.

<h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Preamble</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This Discord is <strong>strictly</strong> a space for individuals outside the gender binary - nonbinary, agender, genderqueer, and other genderweird identities are all welcome. We welcome individuals who are questioning their gender, but if you solely identify as a binary gender, we kindly request that you leave the server.
</div>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Community Expectations</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Nonbinary Zone Discord</strong> should be a safe place for everybody regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size/shape, class, race, age, or religion.

<li>We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, non-binaryphobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.</li>

<div style="text-align: center;">These things are <em>not okay.</em></div><br>


<strong>If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let's:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listen without interruption.</li>
