  Welcome to the <strong>Nonbinary Zone</strong> Discord community! It is a requirement of entry that you read <strong>everything</strong> here before interacting, so please take the time to do so.
  <br><br>
</h6>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Preamble</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This Discord is <strong>strictly</strong> a space for individuals outside the gender binary - nonbinary, agender, genderqueer, and other genderweird identities are all welcome. We welcome individuals who are questioning their gender, but if you solely identify as a binary gender, we kindly request that you leave the server.
</div>
<br />
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Community Expectations</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Nonbinary Zone Discord</strong> should be a safe place for everybody regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size/shape, class, race, age, or religion.
<br>
<br>
<ol type="i" style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>As a member of this community, you agree that:</strong>
<br><ul>
<li>We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.</li>
<li>We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.</li>
<li>We respect people's boundaries and identities, <strong>including their right to not reveal their gender identity outside of this Discord</strong>.</li>
<li>We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, non-binaryphobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.</li>
<li>We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>We actively work towards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being a safe community</li>
<li>Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other</li>

</ul></li></ol></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">These things are <em>not okay.</em></div><br>


<strong>If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let's:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listen without interruption.</li>
<li>Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.</li>
<li>Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.</li>
<li>Apologize and ask forgiveness.</li>
</ul>
Failing to follow the community guidelines as described on this page carries consequences.

</div>

<h6>How do I invite someone to the server?</h6>
Message an admin and ask for an invite link. We'll provide you with a single-use access code.
<br><br>
<h6>How do I set my pronouns?</h6>
We have a bot for that! Click here to select your pronouns.
<br><br>
<h6>What's the deal with that monkey? 🙊</h6>
Don't worry, you're not in trouble! That's Iwazaru, a bot that gently nudges you when you use oppressive language in a message - inadvertently, we're sure. Click on the monkey react to have the bot explain where you went wrong. We're all learning, so just do your best to not do it again.
